## [Unreleased]

### Added
* `demos/usage-dag-edges.py`: Show different types of edges in a DAG
* `demos/usage-elements-extra.py`: Shows how to load external layouts, otherwise same app as `usage-elements.py`.
* `dash_cytoscape.load_extra_layouts()`: A new function that can be called before initializing the Dash app (`app = dash.Dash(__name__)`) to load the JS bundle containing the external layouts. 
* `webpack.[dev|prod].extra.config.js`: Two new webpack configs for external layouts.
* `src/lib/extra_index.js`: Loads external layouts before exporting the `Cytoscape` class. Needed to generate the new bundles.
* Images of new external layouts.
* `dash_cytoscape/dash_cytoscape_extra.[min|dev].js`: New bundles containing the extra layouts. Those bundles are double in size compared to the default bundles. Therefore, they are only loaded when the user uses `load_extra_layouts()` to limit bandwidth usage and maximize loading speed. Please view [fast3g-cytoscape](demos/images/fast3g-cytoscape.PNG) for an example of the impact on loading time.

### Changed
* `src/lib/components/Cytoscape.react.js`: Updated description to include information about new external layouts.
* `package.json`: Added new builds for the extra layouts, modified `npm build:all` to include new builds. Added external layouts as dependencies.

## [0.0.5] - 2019-03-08

### Added
* Two new demos: `usage-grid-social-network.py` and `usage-concentric-social-network.py`
* Add Issue and PR templates for Github (located in `.github`)
* `tests.test_usage`: Tests for rendering usage files.
* `tests.test_callbacks`: Tests for updating `Cytoscape` with callbacks.
* `tests.test_interactions`: Tests for interacting with `Cytoscape`, and evaluating its event callbacks.
* `tests.test_percy_snapshot`: Creates a Percy build using screenshots from other tests.

### Changed
* `usage-*.py`: Modified all the import statements from `import dash_cytoscape` to `import dash_cytoscape as cyto`. Optimized imports. They are now linted with pylint/flake8.
* `demos/usage-*`: Formatted all demo apps in order to respect pylint and flake8.
* `usage-phylogeny.py`: Clear callback conditional statement
* `CONTRIBUTING.md`: changed `dash-cytoscape-0.0.1` to `dash-cytoscape-x.x.x`. Added a **Code quality & design** section. Changed the **Making a contribution** section and updated title to **Publishing**. Updated **Pre-Release checklist**. Added the **Development** section from `README.md` (renamed **Setting up the environment**). Added a **Tests** section.
* `npmignore`: Added `venv` to avoid venvs to be included in the npm distribution package, which makes us a large amount of space and many unnecessary files being distributed.
* `config.yml`: Added steps to run the new tests. Added coverage for Python 3.7. Included `demos` and all usage examples in `pylint` and `flake8`. Increased line limit to 100.
* `README.md`: Moved the **Development** section to `CONTRIBUTING.md`. Modified the dash version in **Prerequisites**.
* `requirements.txt`: Updated the dash version to latest.
* `tests/requiremens.txt`: Updated the dash version to latest.
* `package.json`: Removed `"prepublish": "npm run validate-init"` due to conflict with CircleCI build. This script will be deprecated in favor of the upcoming Dash Component CLI.
* `tests/IntegrationTests.py`: Moved the `percy_snapshot` method to `test_percy_snapshot` in order to avoid duplicate (failing) builds on Percy. Decrease the number of processes to 1.
* `setup.py`: Added classifiers and download_url.

### Removed
* `extract-meta.js`, `extract-meta` - they were moved to the dash component CLI, thus are not needed anymore
* `config.py`, `runtime.txt`, `Procfile`, `index.html` - only needed for hosting `usage-*.py` on DDS, they are now moved to `plotly/dash-cytoscape-demos`.
* `review_checklist.md` -  redundant since all the information is already contained in CONTRIBUTING.md
* `tests.test_render`: Removed unused test
