## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure that dash and its dependent libraries are correctly installed:
```commandline
pip install dash dash-html-components
```

If you want to install the latest versions, check out the [Dash docs on installation](https://dash.plot.ly/installation).


### Usage

Install the library using pip:

```
pip install dash-cytoscape
```

Create the following example inside an `app.py` file:

```python
import dash
import dash_cytoscape as cyto
import dash_html_components as html

app = dash.Dash(__name__)
app.layout = html.Div([
    cyto.Cytoscape(
        id='cytoscape',
        elements=[
            {'data': {'id': 'one', 'label': 'Node 1'}, 'position': {'x': 50, 'y': 50}},
            {'data': {'id': 'two', 'label': 'Node 2'}, 'position': {'x': 200, 'y': 200}},
            {'data': {'source': 'one', 'target': 'two','label': 'Node 1 to 2'}}
        ],
        layout={'name': 'preset'}
    )
])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run_server(debug=True)
```

### External layouts

You can also add external layouts. Use the `cyto.load_extra_layouts()` function to get started:

```python
import dash
import dash_cytoscape as cyto
import dash_html_components as html

cyto.load_extra_layouts()

app = dash.Dash(__name__)
app.layout = html.Div([
    cyto.Cytoscape(...)
])
```

## Documentation

The [Dash Cytoscape User Guide](https://dash.plot.ly/cytoscape/) contains everything you need to know about the library. It contains useful examples, functioning code, and is fully interactive. You can also use the [component reference](https://dash.plot.ly/cytoscape/reference/) for a complete and concise specification of the API. 

To learn more about the core Dash components and how to use callbacks, view the [Dash documentation](https://dash.plot.ly/).

For supplementary information about the underlying Javascript  API, view the [Cytoscape.js documentation](http://js.cytoscape.org/).
